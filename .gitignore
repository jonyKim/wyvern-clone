# Getting Started with Create React App
This project is from https://github.com/wyvernprotocol/wyvern-v3 for analysis and needs to set truffle.
I clone from wyvern-v3 Git and run the yarn command, a build error occurs in my computer environment.
So I reconfigured to build and running. 
Packages required during the analysis process will be added one by one. 

Model Name: Mac mini
